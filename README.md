# AREP Lab1

This laboratory intends for the students to rememeber the knowledge of git and maven.
In this laboratory we need to return the mean and the standard deviation of a given array of number. To achieve this i implemented my own version of the java linked list, and use it to calculate the mean and the standard deviation of a given set of numbers, stored on my own implememntation of Nodes.


## Getting Started

You can download a copy of the project from git hub, to run it you need to run app.java

### Prerequisites

You will need maven and java installed on your computer to employ this program


### Installing

First you need to install java and jdk.
Go to java page and download both, install them and add the paths of those folders to the enviroment variables of your pc.
For maven you download the zip archive from the maven page and unpack it on a specific folder, the you add the path to that folder on the enviroment variables
