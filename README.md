# AREP Lab1

This laboratory intends for the students to rememeber the knowledge of git and maven.
In this laboratory we implement our own version of the java linked list, and use it to calculate the mean and the standard deviation of a given set of doubles thata are on a separated txt.
To achieve this we also implement our own verison of Nodes that a specific value and know the next and the prior nodes.

## Getting Started

You can download a copy of the project from git hub, to run it you need to run app.java

### Prerequisites

You will need maven and java installed on your computer to employ this program


### Installing

First you need to install java and jdk.
Go to java page and download both, install them and add the paths of those folders to the enviroment variables of your pc.
For maven you download the zip archive from the maven page and unpack it on a specific folder, the you add the path to that folder on the enviroment variables


## Running the tests

To run the tests open any ide and go to the test folder, there you run the test.

### Break down into end to end tests

These tests test from the cronstruction of the nodes and the linked list, to the setting of the parameters of the nodes, the adding and removing of nodes from the linked list and obtaining values on specific indexes on the linked list
